- Programmed with NetBeans

main class: databaseworkbench.DatabaseWorkbench

Some explaining maybe needed for this software:
- "Field types" what you add thru settings menu, are your own generic field types, example ID, first name, lastname
- "Languages" are what you gonna program, C++, C#, Php, Java, SQL, what ever you like, add those.
- "Codes", this is where this getting interesting. your own added field types can be specified to your programming languages, 
  * for example: ID named field type can be specified to your programming languages, SQL can be "long", but in C++ it can be "long int"
  * ZipCode named field type can be in SQL varchar(5), but in java language it would be only String typed.
  * Get it?
